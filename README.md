## What is `HostRouter`?

`HostRouter` extends Vapor's routing capabilities by allowing you to include routes for the host domain along with the resource. This makes it easy to partition a domain running on a single server with dynamic routing for different users or services.

`Host Router` was heavily inspired by by a [post](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/2745#issuecomment-1450795410) by @andreasley on the Vapor repo, along with Vapor's own [`DefaultResponder`](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/blob/main/Sources/Vapor/Responder/DefaultResponder.swift).
